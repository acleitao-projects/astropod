In this episode of AI Hub, hosts Larry and Amanda delve into the controversial use of AI by the UK government to detect benefits fraud. Drawing insights from a recent Guardian investigation, they discuss how AI sifts through vast amounts of data, flagging potential fraudulent claims for further human review. However, this raises significant ethical questions about transparency, bias, and the impact on vulnerable individuals. Tune in as they unpack the implications of AI's role in public services and the heightened concerns over mass surveillance and accountability.
