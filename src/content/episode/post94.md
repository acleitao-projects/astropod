In this episode of AI Hub, hosts Larry and Amanda delve deep into a critical yet often overlooked aspect of artificial intelligenceâ€”the energy consumption of AI technologies. Inspired by a recent article, they explore the surprising carbon footprint of AI models, particularly the dramatic differences in energy usage between popular platforms like ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing. With predictions that AI could consume 3.5% of global electricity by 2030, they discuss the implications for power grids, the potential for an AI divide between wealthy and developing nations, and innovative solutions such as neuromorphic computing. Tune in to learn how we can develop sustainable AI practices and what steps individuals and companies can take to reduce their energy footprint.
